- 👋 Hi Everyone, I’m @bobbi-jpg 
- 👀 I’m interested in ... HMTL, CSS, and most recently Python for Data Anyalysis. I found that my original love for creativity and finding answers is exactly what Data Analysis is all about! Since then I've been exploring it more and trying to incorportate better problem solving strategies through what I learn in my data sets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... Data Analysis on open-source tools such as Python and R. FreeCodeCamp is where I'm currently learning Data Analysis.
- 💞️ I’m currently not looking to collaborate ... but I love getting to know others and share ideas on how we can do better! Education is powerful and we should try our best to share freely whenever possible.
